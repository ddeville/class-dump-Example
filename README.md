## class-dump OS X sample application

This project is a simple OS X application that makes use of the Cocoa [ClassDump.framework](https://github.com/ddeville/class-dump).

It simply class-dump its own executable and exports the headers to a temporary directory. While not very helpful in practice it is an example of how to integrate the ClassDump.framework into a Cocoa application.

See this blog [post](http://ddeville.me/2013/08/a-class-dump-cocoa-framework/) for more information.
